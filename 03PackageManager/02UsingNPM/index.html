	<h1>Using Libraries with a Package Manager</h1>
	
	<p>Manually downloading libraries and keeping them up to date is complicated 
	<br>Let's use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">Node Package Manager (npm)</a> to do it for us!
	<br>Now all we have to do is initialize npm for our project, and tell it to install our library
	<br>This also lets us share our project without having to directly share all the node modules.
	<br>We simply share our package.json file and others can download the modules for themselves through npm</p>
