	<h1>Using Babel as a Transpiler</h1>
	
	<p>A transpiler like <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> can help us ensure that our new JavaScript features remain compatible with older browsers.
	<br>By installing babel via npm, and adding it's loader to our webpack build step with some extra rules, 
	<br>we can translate (transpile) our new features into "regular" JavaScript.
	<br>We can also see this by searching through our bundle.js file to find that our use of a template string has been converted to normals tring concatenation
