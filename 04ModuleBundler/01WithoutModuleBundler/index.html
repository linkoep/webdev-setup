	<h1>Using Libraries without a Module Bundler</h1>
	
	<p>Although we can now automatically install and update libraries/packages, we are still manually including each one from the node_modules folder in our HTML Code.
	<br>Essentially, we are creating a global variable, that all scripts after its declaration have access to.
	<br>Even if we use node.js to load our libraries for us, once the website is running in the browser, we no longer have access to the file system
	<br>We can see this by checking out the errors in the console</p>
