	<h1>Configuring Webpack</h1>
	
	<p>When we started using webpack, we had to manually specify the bundling entry point: 
		<br>Our main javascript file that used "require" to include other libraries,
		<br>As well as the filename we wanted for our output.
		<br>We can automate this process by creating the "webpack.config.js" file, which allows us to simply run webpack without having to worry about various arguments.
		<br>This file also allows us to add other advance features to our build step.
