# Using Node
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime essentially used as a backend/server.
After installing node, we can run JavaScript from within the command line. This module includes
only the most basic use of node, as its focus is mainly installation and familiarity with
the command line, which is hard to display on github.

A good overview of how node fits into JavaScript and Web Development can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF5_MPSNAtU&index=1&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6atTSxoRiVnSuOn6JHnq2yV). 
This video also introduces a fun project I plan on exploring after this one. More in-depth workshops
on node can befound [here](https://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers).
