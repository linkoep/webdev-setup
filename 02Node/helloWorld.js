//Having installed node, we can run javascript programs from the command line
//This is essentially a basic backend in javascript
//Using node, we can interact with other libraries or APIs as a server would
console.log('Hello World!');

//Note that this module currently does not focus on extensively using node, but 
//rather focuses on proper installation of node and usage of the command line
